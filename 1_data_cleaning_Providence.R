## read in CDI data. Note that this was imported in raw form from http://wordbank.stanford.edu/.

# The list of word types was coded for its 'basic level' form (e.g. "woof woofy woof" was coded as "woof woof" to match the CDI form)
# Anything not related to a CDI word was coded as blank
# this was then saved as its own document so that the CDI and the type as produced in the corpus are kept in one separate document

  rename("Gloss" = "word") %>%
  distinct(Gloss, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%

# This script takes the .csv files generated in Phon and cleans up the data to include only the words used in the analysis

# In Phon: Specialized > WordMatch
#  Untick: Stress pattern, Include length diacritics, Include stress markers
#  Tick: Exact match, Syllable count, Ignore diacritics, Include syllable boundaries

# Data is imported as Excel file; before importing into R, go through each file and save as a .csv
# then open each file individually in Excel and go through the following processes to make the data readable in this script:
# (this doesn't work in R as far as I can tell)

# - stress markersˈˌ
# - length marker ː
# - nasalized vowels ̃
# - syllabic consonants ̩
# - aspiration ʰ (be sure to match case)
# - rhoticity ˞
# - Not sure: ^
# - dark /l/: ɫ
# - Also replaced IPA /g/ with keyboard <g> as it wasn't reading for some reason
# - and r with <r> as also wasn't reading

# # I started by manually removing diacritics from the .csv file - all syllabic markers, length markers and aspiration. I also removed any glottal stops that were in 
# # consonant clusters. The code will then run properly as it can read all other IPA symbols.


# Finally, aggregate into one large file:
