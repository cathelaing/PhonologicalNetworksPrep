# PhonologicalNetworksPrep - Updated 26th May 2023

This repo includes all the code needed to generate the data for the project in the repo https://github.com/cathelaing/PhonologicalNetworks. As two corpora are used in the project, scripts are run for each of these separately.

These corpora are drawn from Phon (https://www.phon.ca/phon-manual/index.html):

-Providence (US English); 5 infants (3 females) from Demuth et al, 2006
-Lyon (French); 4 infants (2 females) from Demuth & Tremblay, 2008
